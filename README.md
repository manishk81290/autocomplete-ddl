# Getting Started with Auto complete search

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Steps to run project at your end:

First let's clone the repo [autocomplete-ddl](https://github.com/manishk81290/autocomplete-ddl.git)

## Available Scripts

After clone in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies. (In this project i have used only material icons and css from one of my other projects just to make the UI quick)

## !IMPORTANT!

Before running the app add client id and client secret in the .env.prod file to get the api data.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

you will see a search-input to search the user by typing the username.

once you have the user list in front of you and after selecting one of them you will have the detail view of that particular user.
